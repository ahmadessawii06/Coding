    <h2 id="cpp">C++</h2>
    <p>
      C++ is a powerful programming language used for system and software
      development, game engines, and performance-critical applications. It gives
      developers full control over memory and system resources. C++ combines the
      efficiency of low-level programming with the abstraction of high-level
      programming, making it one of the most versatile languages. You can use it
      to build desktop apps, operating systems, compilers, and even embedded
      systems. Its object-oriented features allow developers to organize code
      cleanly and reuse it efficiently.

    <h2 id="python">Python</h2>
    <p>
      Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its simplicity and
      readability. It is widely used in web development, data science, machine
      learning, and automation. Because of its clear syntax, Python is perfect
      for beginners as well as professionals. It has a massive ecosystem of
      libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow that make complex tasks
      easier. Whether you're building a website, training an AI model, or
      analyzing data, Python has the tools you need.

    <h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web
      pages. It defines the structure of content using elements like headings,
      paragraphs, images, and links. HTML works together with CSS for styling
      and JavaScript for interactivity. Every website you visit is built on top
      of HTML. It's not a programming language, but rather a markup language
      that organizes and labels the parts of a web page so browsers can display
      them correctly. Learning HTML is the first step to becoming a web
      developer.
    </p>

    <h2 id="js">JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript is the programming language of the web. It allows developers to
      make websites interactive and dynamic. With JavaScript, you can update
      content without reloading the page, create animations, validate forms, and
      handle user input. It runs directly in the browser and works alongside
      HTML and CSS to create full-featured web experiences. JavaScript has also
      expanded beyond the browser with tools like Node.js, allowing developers
      to build servers and back-end applications using the same language.
